Parallax mapping for GZDoom
===========================

This pk3 contains a small sample set of textures along with a parallax shader.
It gives a small taste of how Doom might look like if it had a more complete set of textures.

Special thanks to Michael Obersnel for creating the patch textures this set was based on.
